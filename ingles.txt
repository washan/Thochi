I am not a very active person. I only like to play soccer , I play futsal every 15 days, 
in an indoor square located in St. Ana, with my friends. The problem is that after that, we 'll drink too many beers.

I try not to eat too much junk food, but it is very difficult to avoid these food on Fridays, 
because my co-workers and I go out to eat.

In my company, we provide the service nutritionist, but I only made one appointment, 
but I wanted to remove coffee sugar from my diet.


Sometimes I enjoy hiking on weekends , I really like this activity because it allows me to spend time with nature and animals. 
I'm from San Carlos and I was brought up in the forest.

I like to eat a lot of fruit , so ,I bought a blender and I like to make smoothies.I normally drink them in the evening.

That 's all I can talk about things I do to keep fit .
